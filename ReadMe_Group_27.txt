Project Name:
    Comparison of Various Searching Strategies for Auto-Suggestion - Trie, KMP, Suffix Tree, Finite Automata

Project Summary:
    Our project investigates efficient pattern searching and auto-suggestion techniques within text files, leveraging advanced data structures and algorithms. We developed a tool that incorporates Trie and Suffix Tree data structures, as well as the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) and Finite Automata algorithms, to enhance the speed and accuracy of pattern matching. Each method's performance was evaluated to determine the most effective approach for specific search scenarios, with a focus on time complexity.

    To further improve user experience, we integrated an auto-suggestion feature that generates real-time word recommendations based on partial input. This feature is particularly useful for applications requiring responsive, predictive text support. Our tool provides detailed outputs, including line numbers and the frequency of each pattern's occurrences, making it comparable to the “Ctrl+F” functionality for searching text within a document.

Compilation Instructions:
    1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC).
    2. Place the source code files and `sherlock.txt` in the same directory.
    3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
    4. Navigate to the directory containing the files.
    5. Compile the code using the following command:  
        gcc pattern.c -o pattern.exe
    6. Run the executable with the following command:
        ./pattern.exe
    7. Follow the prompts to input your search patterns.
        Please make sure to have `sherlock.txt` open alongside the code to run the searches effectively.
